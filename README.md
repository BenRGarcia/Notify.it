# Notify.it

“Notify.it Reddit Notifications” an iOS/Web app that sends real time notifications when new Reddit posts are made that match your keywords. Notify.it is designed to be most useful for fast-paced, time sensitive postings such as those on /r/rocketleagueexchange.

Notify.it is the free easy to use application that notifies you within 30 seconds when your favorite topics pop up.
Done in 3 quick and easy steps:

Notify.it has been updated to include suggestions from the community and be overall easier to use. The updates include:
